# Temporal Load Testing

Let's do some load testing on Temporal.
<!-- 
## Create Cluster

```shell
eksctl create cluster \
--name vantage-temporal \
--version 1.28 \
--region us-east-2 \
--nodegroup-name temporal-nodes \
--node-type t2.large \
--nodes 3
```

### Rightsizing nodes & pods

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html#AvailableIpPerENI

- 2 system pods per node
- 1 ip reserved per node

pod capacity per node = `(nics * addrs) - 3`

### Install Volume Handler

EKS doesn't come with a default volume handler. We need to install one.

First, check if it's already installed:

```shell


```shell
eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --region=us-east-2 --cluster=vantage-temporal --approve

eksctl create addon --name aws-ebs-csi-driver \
  --cluster vantage-temporal \
  --region us-east-2 \
  --service-account-role-arn arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/AmazonEKS_EBS_CSI_DriverRole \
  # --force
``` -->
<!-- 
## Install Temporal & Monitoring

Using: https://github.com/VantageDiscovery/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/temporalio

In the Temporal chart's directory:

1. Change the `web` service type to `LoadBalancer` in `values.yaml`. This lets us access the UI from the itnernet.

    ```yaml
    web:
    enabled: true
    ...
    service:
      # set type to NodePort if access to web needs access from outside the cluster
      # for more info see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types
      type: ClusterIP  <--- CHANGE THIS TO 'LoadBalancer'
      port: 8080
      annotations: {}
      ```

    > For external access, NodePorts require an Ingress Controller. We've used a   LoadBalancer here because they require no further setup and are managed by the cloud provider (AWS).

1. Update helm dependencies

    ```shell
    helm dependencies update
    ```

1. Create the `temporal` namespace (you can call it whatever you want)

    ```shell
    k create ns temporal
    ```

1. Install the chart

    This installs Temporal, CassandraDB, Prometheus, and Grafana.

    ```shell
    # helm install temporaltest . --timeout 15m -n temporal
    
    helm install \
    --set server.replicaCount=1 \
    --set cassandra.config.cluster_size=1 \
    --set prometheus.enabled=true \
    --set grafana.enabled=true \
    --set elasticsearch.enabled=false \
    temporaltest . --timeout 15m
    ```

    > `temporaltest` is the name of the Helm release. You can call it whatever you want. -->

## Load Test Deployment

Using: <https://github.com/temporalio/benchmark-workers/pkgs/container/benchmark-workers>

_NOTE: this document uses the alias `k` for `kubectl` (and you should too!)_

### Create a dir for our files

  ```shell
  mkdir load && cd load
  ```

### Create the deployment manifest
  
Copy the contents of <https://github.com/temporalio/benchmark-workers/blob/main/deployment.yaml> into a file named `deployment.yaml`.

### Deploy the load test

  ```shell
  > k apply -f deployment.yaml 
  deployment.apps/benchmark-workers created
  deployment.apps/benchmark-soak-test created
  ```

### Confirm the activity in Temporal UI

As soon as you deploy the load test, you should see activity in the Temporal UI. Click the reload button in the top right to see the latest activity: â†»

The ID hashes should be changing every few seconds, and you should see new workflows being created.

### Stop the test

The quick-and-dirty way to stop the test is to just delete the loading deployment:

  ```shell
  k delete -f deployment.yaml
  ```

Alternatively, you can scale down the deployment:

  ```shell
  k scale deployment benchmark-workers --replicas=0
  ```

You can of course use your k8s interface of choice to do this as well (k9s, openlens, etc)

### Modifying the load testing

#### Scale up workers

You can increase the load by scaling up the deployment:

  ```shell
  k scale deployment benchmark-soak-test --replicas=10
  ```

#### Change the load test

The `soak-test` runner can be adjusted either with Environment Variables or with command line flags.

See the official documentation for details: <https://github.com/temporalio/benchmark-workers/pkgs/container/benchmark-workers#runner>

#### Run with tctl

As an alternative to the above options, you can run benchmark tests directly with `tctl`.

Once the worker is deployed, shell into the pod container, and execute:

```shell
tctl workflow start --taskqueue benchmark --workflow_type ExecuteActivity --execution_timeout 60 -i '{"Count":1,"Activity":"Sleep","Input":{"SleepTimeInSeconds":3}}'
```

this isn't isn't working right now. :arrow-up:

### Import the Temporal dashboards

In the Grafana UI, paste the content of `./server-general.json` into the Dashboard import window.

- pulled from <https://github.com/temporalio/dashboards/blob/master/server/server-general.json>

## Log In to grafana

user/pass should be admin/admin
